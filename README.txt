Hi Mr abdallah 
im sorry to inform you that the project isn't fully completed yet due to time constrains as well as exhaustion and burnout 
if i were in a good condition i would have ended it sooner and much more perfectlly than this.
project is a garage system that includes stepper motor, lcd, Keypad, usart and adc.
sorry to say i didnt have time and energy to implement the EEPROM into the project
hope you understand my situation ,thank you
